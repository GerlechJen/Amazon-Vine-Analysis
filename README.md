# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Overview
As the first data expert at BigMarket, a startup company that helps businesses optimize their marketing efforts, I am required to assist one of BigMarketâ€™s clients SellBy to run some hefty analytics. SellBy is about to release a large catalog of products on a leading retail website. They want to know how the reviews of their products compare to the reviews of similar products sold by their competitors. Aside from this, they also want to enroll in a program that gives out free products to select reviewers, but they would want to know if it is worth the cost.
I will be analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. SellBy has paid a small fee to Amazon and provided products to Amazon Vine members, who are required to publish a review.

In this project, using approximately 50 datasets each containing reviews of a specific product, from clothing apparel to wireless products. I will need to pick one of these datasets and use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. 
Next, I will use PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset.
